EMP-Disk-Launcher
=================

Senior Design Project

This is the code written to control the EMP Disk Launcher used by the Science Brothers. The idea was to make a controller
capable of simplifying and streamlining the use of the disk launcher.

File version A is to be used on the Remote controller.
File version B is to be used in the launch system.
